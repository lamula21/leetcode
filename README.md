## Arrays

Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures in computer science. They consist of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.

1. [Two Sum](Arrays/Two_Sum.py) - Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

2. [Maximum Subarray](Arrays/Maximum_Subarray.py) - Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

## Strings

Strings are a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. They are one of the most commonly used data types in programming.

1. [Reverse String](Strings/Reverse_String.py) - Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

2. [Valid Palindrome](Strings/Valid_Palindrome.py) - Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

## Linked Lists

Linked lists are linear data structures where each element is a separate object, called a node, comprising a data and a reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.

1. [Merge Two Sorted Lists](LinkedLists/Merge_Two_Sorted_Lists.py) - Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list.

2. [Linked List Cycle](LinkedLists/Linked_List_Cycle.py) - Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

## Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes.

1. [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](Trees/Binary_Tree_Inorder_Traversal.py) - Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

2. [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](Trees/Maximum_Depth_of_Binary_Tree.py) - Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

## Graphs

Graphs are a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. They are used to model pairwise relationships between objects.

1. [Number of Islands](Graphs/Number_of_Islands.py) - Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

2. [Course Schedule](Graphs/Course_Schedule.py) - There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It's particularly useful for optimization problems.

1. [Climbing Stairs](DynamicProgramming/Climbing_Stairs.py) - You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

2. [Maximum Subarray](DynamicProgramming/Maximum_Subarray.py) - Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

## Other Topics

This section includes problems that don't fit neatly into the previous categories but are still important for coding interviews and competitive programming.

1. [LRU Cache](OtherTopics/LRU_Cache.py) - Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

2. [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](OtherTopics/Median_of_Two_Sorted_Arrays.py) - Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
